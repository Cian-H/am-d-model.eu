            AM-D-Model is an ESAFORM benchmark project aiming to create the data
            that will drive the future of Laser Powder-Bed-Fusion (L-PBF)
            research and innovation. By connecting an international network of
            collaborators AM-D-Model will create a comprehensive, open L-PBF
            benchmark dataset. As part of our commitment to open science, this
            dataset will be openly shared with the research community. Our goal
            is to create a universal benchmark for the L-PBF community, sparking
            the collaboration and innovation that will build the future of this
            technology.
